* Board tiles should be random and each tile has 6 points since its hexagon
* Make another list for all the dots in the map, each dot knows what tiles its standing next to.
* in the list of the dots we have a list of Map(dot p1, dot p2) thats how we know the roads in the game (easy to check if there is already a roard).
-------

* initialize given the Hardcoded map, a list of the 71 roads and 53 dots, the dot
will have a variable for his neighbors.
creating the board will be the list of tiles, list of roads, list of dots
the tiles are hardcoded, so will be the dot's neighbors.
