* Board tiles should be random and each tile has 6 points since its hexagon
* Make another list for all the dots in the map, each dot knows what tiles its standing next to.
* in the list of the dots we have a list of Map(dot p1, dot p2) thats how we know the roads in the game (easy to check if there is already a roard).
